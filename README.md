# Pensheen Steno

This is a system for writing machine stenograph outlines using symbols. It uses the standard English (Ireland) layout and is independent of theory.

For documentation, consult the [illustration of key lines](./key_lines.pdf) or the [technical specifications](./spec.md).

Originally designed independently but later found codepoke's [Pen Steno](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2018/12/using-machine-stenography-in-pen.html), which I borrowed many consonant shapes from. Thank you for helping to beat my idea into shape.

The goals of this system are slightly different from most pen stenography "shorthand" systems. I am very slow to write out long strings of capital letters, which take up a lot of space. This system does not prioritize speed, but rather seeks to be more compact for long strokes, be relatively easy to read, and impart a bit of calligraphic beauty. 

TODO: Add actual examples of use.
