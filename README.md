# Pensheen Steno

This is a system for writing machine stenograph outlines using symbols. It assumes the standard English (Ireland) layout and is independent of theory.

Originally designed independently but later found codepoke's [Pen Steno](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2018/12/using-machine-stenography-in-pen.html), which I borrowed many consonant shapes from. Thank you for helping to beat my idea into shape.

The goals of this system are slightly different from most pen stenography "shorthand" systems. I am very slow to write out long strings of capital letters, which take up a lot of space. This system does not prioritize speed, but rather seeks to be more compact for long strokes, be relatively easy to read, and impart a bit of calligraphic beauty. 

TODO: Add images with examples and explanation text to accompany the dry, technical specification no one should read.
